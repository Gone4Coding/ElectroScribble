# ElectroScribble 
*Scribbletune + Electron*


**ElectroScribble** is a project where I experiment with:

* [Electron](https://electron.atom.io)
* [Scribbletune](http://scribbletune.com/)
* [Soundfont-Player](https://github.com/danigb/soundfont-player)
* [midijs](http://www.midijs.net/)

**UI**:
* [Kickstart](http://getkickstart.com)
* Keyboard CSS [Luiz Felipe Tartarotti Fialho](http://www.felipefialho.com/)


## Running the app:

Assuming you have **node, npm** installed...

Clone or download the project
In the git bash:

Install all the dependencies with:
`npm install`

to start the app:
`npm start`

Enjoy! :)


**Progress so far**:
**Very very basic UI** has been done. It allows for: 
* playing the notes on the keyboard
* changing the instruments, 
* capturing the notes
* setting the pattern
* generating the `.mid` file
* playing generated `.mid` file


**TODO**:
* Add more Scribbletune functions (selecting chords, extending pattern length, sizzle etc.)
* creating 'Piano Roll' to controll the notes, chords, pattern, volums etc.
* UI improvements
* Rewrite in TypeScript & code cleanup
